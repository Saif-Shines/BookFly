Meeting 5 - Phase 3 - 12/04/2015

* GENERAL NOTES *

- Biron and Andrew have been having issues with getting Android studio to work on their machines, so my 05/12 they should aim to have that fixed so they can start working on implementing more front end features for client. Until then, they are also aiming to add unit tests for the features that they added in the backend. 


* STATUS UPDATE *

- Axel: Implemented serialization so that it is fully functional for the database, which was made possible by completing the change of the database to a singleton. This change also caused us to remove all the static references in Database, and make corresponding changes to all of the backend classes, and changed the User class from an Interface to an Abstract class, and made necessary changes to Admin and Client. Axel also fixed the bug with searchFlights where the app crashed, having to do with the AndroidManifest and where the view was set in AdminSearchFlightRequest. Axel is finished implementing searchClients and just needs to iron out one bug with the wrong string output. 
- Tayyab: Finished implementing searchFlights, and helped Axel address view bug. Reviewed all the mistakes made in PII and worked on fixes for submission of PIII. 

* TASK ASSIGNMENT *

- Tayyab: Implement client login functionality, and decide with axel which client features should be added first. 
- Axel: Decide with Tayyab which client features should be added first, then begin implementation. 

- Biron and Andrew: Working on getting android studio to work on their machines, and in the meantime make extensive Junit tests. Once that is complete they will begin adding client flight booking functionality. 

Meeting 6 - Phase 3 - 12/07/2015

* GENERAL NOTES *

Andrew and Biron have android studio working on their machines now.

* STATUS UPDATE *
Axel - Has finished search flights for User, booking flights (activity and layout) for clients, admin ability to search and book flights for clients. Also added/fixed success and fail checks for all admin activities and cleaned up some of the activity code. Added catches for exceptions so that the app doesn’t crash. Fixed save path so that it isn’t hard coded.  Added client’s ability to view booked itineraries, and debugged client features so they no longer crash, and all work properly. Fixed search flight/itinerary activity, and rerouted Admin’s client activities so they pass through the client main activity, but keep track of the user as an admin. 
Tayyab - Worked on search itineraries, and search flights booking flow, helped test, and debug app. Went over existing code, and fixed errors. Added exception catching for Activities. 
Biron - Merged the Search class over to the abstract User class. Filled out Driver, reviewed function outputs for correctness. Added bookItinerary methods for Admin and Client. Fixed and filled out Java docs on the back end. Searched and wrote test cases looking for stop over issue with Andrew. Completed CRC cards for phase III.
Andrew - Edited addFlight so for flights with the same flight num it now deletes old flight in arraylist and locations map and adds new flight to array list and locations maps. Added ifBookable method to check if itinerary is bookable. Updated getItineraries, getItinerariesSortedByCost and getItinerariesSortedByTime to go through getBookableItineraries. Deleted the Search and SearchTests files completely. All Searching and sorting is now in the User class.


* TASK ASSIGNMENT *
Axel - Add comments to all of the activity code, and clean up hard coded variables, and repeated code. Start work on the README.txt which Tayyab can later finish. Restructure the files and packages in a way that is cleaner. Review and test all front end code. 
Tayyab - Work on User (Client or Admin) can display search results sorted by total travel time or by total cost. Finish README.txt after Axel has started some. Help adding JavaDocs and comments to code. Review and test all frontend code. 
Biron - Test cases for book itinerary. Update CRC cards with any changes.
Andrew - Test driver thoroughly, and help comment and javadoc the backend code.
